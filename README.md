# SivanLittleMemory

SivanLittleMemory is a little PowerShell Memory Game working on **.txt** files
## Long (*boring*) Description

This Script will ask you to enter the root path of your .txt file list, each word (element) of this one have to be seperated and displayed with space

```me
Mario (AVOID SPACE OR COMPOSED NAMES LIKE "ANNE-SOPHIE")
Sonic
Maxine
Chloe
(...)
```

Then, the script will ask you the global question.
Finally, you wil have to enter in order, the words of your list. 

You'll get your results (correct answers) at the end

### Credits
Made only by me (lol) and only with PowerShell ‚ù§
